# Creative Drive Project Backend

This backend was built using:
 - nodejs
 - express
 - mongodb
 - mongoose
 
The purpose of this basic server is to help test the login, register, authentication and list users based on role.

## Run In Development Mode 

Open the project's folder, use "npm install" to install the dependencies and type "node server' to serve the application.
This server will be running on localhost and port 3000. Wait until you receive the "Connected to mongodb" message on your console to make sure your db is online and ready.
